Ever wondered how to name your GitHub repository?

Often we have a very good understanding of what our code does, but we don't know how to put all of that into a single repository name.

That's where _GHRNS_ (GitHub Repository Naming Suggestion Service) comes into play: It automatically suggests meaningful names for your repository based on your repository description.

Suggestions are generated by artificial intelligence from https://openai.com/[OpenAI].

The browser extension automatically detects the current repository you are looking at on GitHub, then you can generate suggestions from the web browser extensions pop-up.

The extension requires credentials for the OpenAI API. Once you have your API key, you can set it up in the extension options and start generating suggestions.

== Privacy practices

=== Single purpose
Its purpose is to generate meaningful repository names for your GitHub repositories. It acs as a helper tool for developers to name their repositories faster and easier.


=== Permission justification

==== `storage` justification
Storage is needed to save the API credentials.

==== `tabs` justification
Access to the browser tabs is needed to detect the current repository. See if the current tab is a GitHub repository, and if so, get the repository name as well as the username, to get the repo description, which then is used to generate the suggestions.
